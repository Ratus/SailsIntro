# Todos
This document lists all things "to be done" for the assignment.
This assignment should be doable within 2 hours (given that the developer has zero knowledge about the sails framework).

## Introduction
First off, it's important that the structure of this application gets explained to the participant. 
A list of aspects to explain:

* New sails app directory structure (models, controllers, assets, grunt tasks etc)
* Routes (creating a new page with view)
* Creating a new model and / or controller
* Blueprints (Such as UserController login)
* Policies (create messages page with participant, protect it with policy and add to nav (when signed in))
* Blueprints CRUD. (Create model Test and show crud actions).
* Explain assets structure (basics).
* Make Message.create explicit route (without action) to explain blueprint CRUD hooks

## Assignment
The assignment is pretty straight forward. Build a **basic** messaging.
User management (registration, login) has been provided already. This means you only need to build:

* Inbox
* Compose
